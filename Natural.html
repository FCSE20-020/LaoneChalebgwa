        <p class="description">The Spree  is, with a length of approximately 400 kilometres (250 mi), is much longer than the Havel, which itself flows into the Elbe at Havelberg. The river rises in the Lusatian Highlands, that are part of the Sudetes, where it has three sources: the historical one called Spreeborn in the village of Spreedorf, the water-richest one in Neugersdorf, and the highest elevated one in Eibau. The Spree then flows northwards through Upper and Lower Lusatia, where it crosses the border between Saxony and Brandenburg. It then flows through Lake Schwielochsee before entering Berlin, as Müggelspree .</p>

The lake lends its name to the surrounding area and to the nearby Studentendorf Schlachtensee, a student residence. The area has been part of Berlin since 1920.</p>

        <p class="description"> Also known as the Großer Müggelsee, is a natural lake in the eastern suburbs of Berlin, the capital city of Germany. It is the largest of the Berlin lakes by area, with an area of 7.4 square kilometres (2.9 sq mi), a length of 4.3 kilometres (2.7 mi) and a breadth of 2.6 kilometres (1.6 mi). The lake itself is 8 metres (26 ft) deep at its deepest point. At its south end are hills called the 'Müggelberge', which are 115 metres (377 ft) high; they were formed during the Pleistocene[1] (as a kettle hole, remaining at Weichselian glaciation).</p>
